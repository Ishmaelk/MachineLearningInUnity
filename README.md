Bitesize machine learning projects utilizing genetic algorithms and neural networks in Unity.

Unity must be installed to run projects. Once installed each of the following projects can be opened in the editor. Simply press the play button at the top of the screen to start.

1) PlatformWalk

  ML agents successively bred generation by generation to stay on a platform while moving.

2) Basic Perceptron

  A Perceptron is created and trained within 8 epochs to calculate OR operations given two inputs. Output is shown on Unity console.
  
3) Perceptron Classification

  A set of objects represent different types of weapons or food. This perceptron classifies those objects into their respective bins by evaluating their traits, sharpness and edibleness. Results are plotted on a graph.
